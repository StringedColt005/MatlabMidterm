This code is designed to take students and organize them in by certain criteria. Those being age, Gpa and major. The code is run by inputting the previously listed criteria as well as their names. This will allow the students to be able to get categorized and then promptly put into the graphics that display their ages, GPAs and average GPA by majors.
